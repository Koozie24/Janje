janje_wars is a text based game based around the player buying and selling various items listed at differnt prices on different days. Loosely based off the scientific Calculator game "Drug Wars".

The player can also play a gambling mini game by using the command drink [amount]. This chance game picks a random number 0 - 99 and checks if it is even or odd. The player will lose the amount of rakija
wagered from their inventory and in exchange either win or lose janje. 

The overall goal is to end the game with more money than the player started with.
